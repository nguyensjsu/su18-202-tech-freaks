> Implement REST APIs that calls the classes and methods from the JAR file.
> Test the RESTful functionalities using Advance Chrome REST API tool.


- What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?

> Merge the library code to form a single JAR file
> Access the methods and classes from the JAR library without adding the entire project folder.

> Test the RESTful functionalities using Advance Chrome REST API tool.
> Begin Android user interface for Add Card, MyCards and Settings Screen.

- What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?

> Had issues with Maven project in Eclipse and so switched to Dynamic Web Project.
> Access the methods and classes from the JAR library without adding the entire project folder. Still working on this issue.

## XP Core Values

### Communication

> Out team does a video chat for 20 minutes once in three days to check our individual progress status.
Everyone is given 5 minutes to explain the above three questions. If one of us needs help, we book for a pair programming video session to resolve issues and clarify doubts.

> I maintain the GitHub project board to tag someone in my team to get help in a particular task. I also specify their name if my code is depended on their code.

### Simplicity

> I plan to implement the basic necessary pages with necessary methods for API calls. Then I have preponed my deadlines three days prior to work on the Extra Credit part of the project.

> Everyone of my team will be implementing a JAR file and set of APIs. We have decided to merge the controller to link our dependencies at the controller level and have a clean development with less/no merge conflicts.


### Courage

> Each of us decided to learn every part of this project and gain hands-on experience with front-end, back-end, database, testing. So that, when we merge our code we will know what and how things work in our project very well. It also helps us to understand and help each other.

> I'm working on Add Card API and so I design the wire-frame, write unit test cases and code the business logic. I also learned to export the project as a JAR file and implement the REST APIs.

### Respect

> Everyone in this team is specialized in a specific domain that when combined together helps us to build this project 100%. We don't proceed with any decision unless everyone shares their opinion on the floor.
